# ps2tosnes
Arduino sketch that lets you use a PS/2 mouse as a replacement SNES mouse.

Useful if your mouse breaks or if you don't own a mouse, but you own a game that can use a mouse.
You could modify it to make a controller version using another type of gamepad, or a TAS playback device.

It requires kristopher's PS2 Mouse arduino library: https://github.com/kristopher/PS2-Mouse-Arduino
